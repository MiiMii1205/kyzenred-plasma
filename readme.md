# Kyzenred
A full KDE theme based on gamer aesthetics and modern minimalism (Plasma theme)

## Dependencies
- KDE >= 5

## Installation
Just put this repository in your `~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/` directory (make a new one if it doesn't exist)

## Usage
To set your plasma theme, you'll need to open up your KDE system manager and go to the [Plasma Theme](https://userbase.kde.org/System_Settings/Plasma_Theme) section.

## Color scheme
Kyzenred comes with its official color scheme. That means that you can use Kyzenred as is.

However, Kyzenred was designed to handle any KDE color scheme you'll throw at it.

To find out how to change your KDE color scheme, [click here](https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/kde-workspace/kcontrol/colors/index.html)!

Plasma should handle your new theme like a boss! You might need to log out and in to fully refresh your desktop first.
